I am Romain, a French PhD student in computer vision at [ENS Ulm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)), supervised by [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/index.html) and [Jean Ponce](https://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/).
I am graduated from [Mines de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_Paris_%E2%80%93_PSL) & [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay) ([MVA](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/mathematiques-et-applications/m2-mathematiques-vision-apprentissage)) - see my [résumé](/resume) for more details.  

Curious by nature, I am intrigued by almost everything that adopts a scientific approach: 
at the forefront are mathematics, machine learning, computer vision, and software engineering - which compose my daily work - yet I am also drawn to more distant subjects such as energy, sociology, geopolitics, and philosophy. 
I try to distill (almost) every week my explorations into short blog posts, hoping they will inspire you to (re)discover interesting domains.  

Off-screen, I am a triathlete on sunny days, a climber & hiker when the air is crisp and cool, and a skier and board-game enthusiast during winter.
